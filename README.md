# Network analysis
Network analysis is a field of study that focuses on the analysis of complex systems composed of interconnected entities, such as social networks, transportation networks, and biological networks. It involves the use of mathematical models and algorithms to describe the structure and dynamics of these networks and to identify important patterns and properties.
A distance matrix and a connectivity matrix are both types of matrices that are used in network analysis to represent the relationships between entities in a network.
A distance matrix represents the pairwise distances between entities in a network where as connectivity matrix, on the other hand, represents the connections between entities in a network.
# Steps
Explore the shape file given

Use NetworkX of Python to do the following 

Use the connectivity matrix to draw the graph (get an output of the graph)

Derive the distance matrix for the given connectivity matrix using the shape file (as per the coordinates given).
# Use any programming language without using in-built function to :

1.       Estimate the area formed by the given series of points.
 
2.       Find whether the line segment formed by (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) intersect with the above polygon and if so find the point of intersection.
